Are you looking for an exciting and innovative final year project that combines cutting-edge technologies with real-world applications? Look no further! Our final year project focuses on the development of a real-time vehicle tracking system using smartphones.

Using a combination of React JS for the front-end, C#.Net for the back-end, Flutter for the mobile app, and SQL for the database, our project aims to create a seamless and intuitive user experience for tracking vehicles in real-time. The system includes features such as live traffic updates, real-time speed monitoring, and route optimization, making it easy to manage vehicles efficiently.

As a final year project, our focus is on research, development, and innovation. We aim to create a reliable, user-friendly system that can be further developed and improved upon by future developers. Our project will be thoroughly documented, ensuring that it can be easily replicated and expanded upon by other students and developers.

Our final year project will be developed over a period of 4 months, with a focus on creating a robust and effective system that meets the needs of real-world applications. We will be sharing our progress on GitHub, allowing for easy collaboration and feedback from other developers and stakeholders.
